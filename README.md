# MECHENG313_Finite_State_Table_project

This was done in collabration with Aaron Zhang

Task1.c
Implementation of a class for finite state tables.
Will create a two-dimensional array named FST, and a struct named cell_fst which groups the variables that makes up the cell of a finite state table.
This class will have methods: SetNextState() and SetActions() which can be used to set the values of any cell in the FST. As well as methods GetNextState() and GetAction() which can be used to return any value of any cell in the FST. + Add Public + Code basic output.
Task2.c
Console application that implements a simple FiniteStateTable.
Allows user to interact with the machine using the keyboard. When ‘a’,’b’,’c’ is pressed the machine will transition to a new state and the transition will be reported back to the user. ‘q’ to quit the application.
All outputs and inputs will be logged with timestamps and saved after the program is exited.

Task 3.c
Console application of two concurrent dependent and synchronous finite state machines. 
Allows user to interact with the machine through keyboard inputs. When ‘a’,’b’,’c’ is pressed the machine will transition to a new state and the transition will be reported back to the user. ‘q’ to quit the application.
All outputs and inputs of both machines will be logged with timestamps and saved after the program is exited

more will be added later
